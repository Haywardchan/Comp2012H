A "save file" is a plaintext file that stores all the data of a database.

The first two lines are the name of the database and the number of tables it has.
The next three lines are the name of a table, the number of columns it has, and the number of rows it has.
Then comes the field names of the table, in one line, separated by a comma and a space. 
Every field name is followed by a single space and a number. 0 represents an integer field and 1 represents a string field. 
The primary key field begins with an asterisk. The order of fields here matches the order in the table.
Then comes the data of the table. Each line represents a single row, and the data for each field is separated by a comma and a space. 
The order of the fields will match the order of the field names. The order of the rows here match the order in the table.
The formats specified in 2, 3, and 4 are repeated for each table. The order of tables here matches the order in the database.
Lastly, if a database is empty (0 table in total) it will not be followed by any table data. On the other hand, 
if a table is empty (0 record in total), it will not be followed by any record data.
There could be tables with some fields but no record. There won't be tables with no field but some records.
